ðŸŽ® Notebook Enterprise Summit 2019

## Context

The purpose of the Notebook Enterprise Summit (NES) is to bring together a small group of
large companies who have heavy investments in Jupyter notebooks and are **actively contributing**
to the open source community. 

The goal of this summit is to **accelerate progress** on areas of **high importance** for
**enterprise** use cases. We will do this by **aligning** on topics of **broad relevance**
and by **connecting people**--including engineers, architects, and leaders--with one another.
